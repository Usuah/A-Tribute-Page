Tribute to my   Fathers/Usuah Jane
It is difficult to write about Inya Abam Eteng, Professor Emeritus, in the yesterday tense. It is difficult to believe that one of the shining lights in the worldâ€™s sociological firmament has suddenly gone dim.The difficulty is worsened when, on a promenade through history, I recollect that I was privileged to have sat under his feet. looking round without him i asked; is that the end of sociological postulations, or the beginning of Utopia? Is that the end of Marxism or the triumph of Capitalism? It cannot be. Rather, it is the praxis or synthesis of both!
    He as a father taught me that challenges of life should be faced squarelly without fear or favour and victory assured at the end. its already seven years gone yet still fresh
Elder Chief G.E.U. Okorie: the taught of you remind me what love is and believe in your children means; you stood up for me when i needed it most in my JSS1 class and made me realize how great it is to have a father. Its five years gone still fresh. 
truly love and admired this two men that fathered me at a given stage of my life.
thank you Daddys
